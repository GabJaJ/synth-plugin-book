# JX11 Synth Audio Demos

These are some recordings made with the JX11 synth from the book *Code Your Own Synth Plug-Ins With C++ and JUCE*, to give you an idea of what the synth sounds like. Some of these recordings were made using the built-in presets, others using modified settings. No additional effects were used, these sounds come straight out of the synth. In some recordings automation was used to modify the parameters of the synth while the music was playing.

**5th Sweep Pad**: Demo of the `5th Sweep Pad` preset. You can clearly hear the filter envelope here.

**Basses**: Various bass presets, with a bit of pitch bend thrown in.

**Echo Pad**: Playing some chords with the `Echo Pad [SA]` preset and the sustain pedal held down.

**Glide**: Demonstrates glide or portamento between notes.

**Organs+Brass**: A sampling of the included organ and brass presets.

**PWM**: Plays different PWM and vibrato settings for the square wave. The last repetition is a sawtooth wave.

**Reso Staccato**: Subtle sweep of filter cutoff and resonance.

**Three Pads**: This has JX11 playing the same notes but on three tracks, with the presets `Synth Strings`, `Space Chimes [SA]`, and `Very Soft Pad`.
